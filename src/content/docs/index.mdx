## Why On-Premises?

In an era of rising cloud costs, data regulations, and vendor lock-in, organizations are bringing workloads back on-prem. ScaleNinja makes this transition seamless.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Predictable Costs" icon="approve-check-circle">
    No surprise bills. No egress fees. No per-API charges. Pay once for your hardware, run your infrastructure at a fraction of public cloud costs. Organizations typically see **60-80% cost reduction** compared to equivalent public cloud deployments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Sovereignty" icon="star">
    Your data stays where you put it. Meet GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific compliance requirements. Maintain complete control over data locality, access, and retention policies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Vendor Lock-in" icon="open-book">
    Built entirely on open source foundations. Standard APIs, portable formats, and no proprietary dependencies. Your infrastructure, your way — migrate workloads freely without penalties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Source Core" icon="github">
    Powered by Apache CloudStack, KVM, Ceph, and other proven open source projects. Benefit from global community innovation, security audits, and transparent development.

## Built for the Modern Data Center

![Modern data center infrastructure](/images/datacenter-diagram.svg)

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Automated Operations" icon="setting">
    Infrastructure-as-code, automated provisioning, self-healing clusters, and intelligent workload placement. Reduce operational overhead while improving reliability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise Security" icon="warning">
    Network isolation, encrypted storage, role-based access control, audit logging, and integration with enterprise identity providers. Security built-in, not bolted on.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hybrid Ready" icon="external">
    Connect to public clouds when you need burst capacity. Unified management across on-prem and cloud resources. The best of both worlds, on your terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="24/7 Support" icon="comment-alt">

## The ScaleNinja Philosophy

We believe infrastructure should be **simple**, **transparent**, and **empowering**.

### Simple
Complex doesn't mean capable. Our platform abstracts away infrastructure complexity while giving you full control when you need it. Deploy a VM in seconds, manage a thousand with the same effort.

### Transparent
No black boxes. Every component is open source, auditable, and well-documented. You can inspect the code, understand the architecture, and modify anything to suit your needs.

### Empowering
Your team should spend time building applications, not fighting infrastructure. ScaleNinja automates the tedious, surfaces the important, and gets out of your way.
